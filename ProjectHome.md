This addon adds menu items and a toolbar button that allow you to easily find all the tracks in your library from an album, artist, genre, year, album artist, or playlist. Using the right click context menu you can find tracks related to the selected track (or tracks) and if you use the toolbar button you can find tracks related to the either the currently playing track or the selected track/tracks. The toolbar button menu also contains a list of all the playlists that contain the currently playing or currently selected track, which when selected will focus on that playlist.
